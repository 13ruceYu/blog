I saw discussions in the community about making choose between [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) and [the Vitesse starter template](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) many times. And most recently [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/wc0k05/vitesse_vs_nuxt_3_which_is_the_best_approach).

So, being **the creator of Vitesse AND a core member of Nuxt**, I think I shall share my position and thoughts on this.

## History of Vitesse

While it seems that Vitesse is offering many features similar to Nuxt 3, it's actually a bit hard to do the comparison without looking into why Vitesse was created.

At the time Vue 3 just enter the beta phrase, Evan You came up with the idea of Vite, a bundless dev server for Vue, provding a much faster hot module replacement (HMR) experience. In that time both Vue 3 and Vite are fairly new, most of the community are still in the wait-and-see attitude. Being a big fan of Vue's new Composition API, I was excited about the new possibilities and wanted to try it out.
